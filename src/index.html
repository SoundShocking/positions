              After I didn’t get matched into a residency program, I was struggling day after day to find a position on
              my own. I was accepted into an open position within days of joining MedResidency. Since then, two of my

              I sent out hundreds of applications to residencies through other sites and didn’t hear back. I’d notice
              the positions were unlisted a few days later in a lot of cases, and realized I was wasting time applying
              for positions that were already closed! I haven’t had that problem since joining MedResidency. In fact, I
              just got informed of my acceptance into my residency dream program which I found through this site. I
              could not be happier.
