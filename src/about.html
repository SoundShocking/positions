        <h2>Let Us Save You Time, Money, and Effort</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges when you are trying to find medical residency programs is to actually find and
          apply for listings which are current.</p>
        <p>You are probably intimately familiar with this hurdle. It isn’t uncommon to send out dozens of applications
          for positions which are already filled, or which are past the deadline.</p>
        <p>If you are fortunate, you’ll figure out a listing is expired before you waste your time. Otherwise, you can
          flush a lot of time and effort down the drain.</p>
        <p>Even if you do read the fine print, it can be exhausting wading through one listing after another which isn’t
          open just to find the opportunities which might still be available.</p>
        <p>Your time is valuable. You already have a considerable amount of debt. The sooner you start working at your
          residency or fellowship, the sooner you can start paying off that debt rather than adding to it.</p>
        <p>To help you take the next step in your career and to eliminate the wasted time and hassles which go with
          searching for a residency on your own, we decided to create a curated, up-to-date list of medical residency
          programs.</p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>On a lot of other websites, what you find are automated or out-of-date listings for residencies.</p>
        <p>Our list is differently, because we carefully curate it, manually adding and removing entries on a continuous
          basis.</p>
        <p>That way, as soon as a new opportunity becomes available, you can find it in our listings and apply for it
          immediately, meeting the deadline.</p>
        <p>We also remove expired listings immediately so that you never waste time with pointless applications.</p>
        <p>In order to bring you as many opportunities as possible, we monitor listings on dozens of websites.</p>
        <p>We can connect you with the following types of opportunities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Residencies</li>
          <li>Fellowships</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is MedResidency Right For You?</h2>
        <p>You can use our site if you are a fourth-year medical student, a prior-year graduate, an international
          medical graduate (IMG), or a current resident or fellow.</p>
        <p>Many members come to us after failing to get a match through NRMP Match or SOAP. But we also serve candidates
          who simply want to change locations or specializations.</p>
        <p>By searching the web to bring you open opportunities, we save you the time and hard work of doing so
          yourself.</p>
        <p>This frees up your time and energy to focus on other aspects of your professional journey.</p>
        <p>Our members also tell us that MedResidency’s services have significantly reduced their stress, making the
          entire process of finding a residency less daunting and more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Finding your next residency or fellowship should be exciting, not stressful, and with our curated database of
          open positions on your side, it can be.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>

        <p>MedResidency is the ultimate residency program search tool. We have made it as easy as 1-2-3 for you to find
          a residency or fellowship.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Sign up</li>
          <li>Search residencies</li>
          <li>Apply</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To sign up on our site, just click the green button in the upper right-hand corner which says “Get Started.”
          This will open a form in which you can input your basic personal details and make your initial month’s
          payment. The database of current residency and fellowship vacancies will then be fully accessible to you.</p>
        <p>You can maintain your access to this database for as long as you need it by making timely monthly payments.
          If you no longer need access, you can simply stop making your payments. No contract is required.</p>
        <p>We have had members tell us they were able to find a residency within days after joining MedResidency after
          searching for weeks or months on other listings.</p>
        <p>How long will it take you to find your next position? It all depends on what you are looking for and what is
          available.</p>
        <p>Since we are constantly updating our listings, we suggest you check in every day until you find what you are
          looking for. The faster you apply, the more likely you are to get the spot of your dreams.</p>

        <h2>Find Your Residency Now</h2>

        <p>However long you have searched, your residency or fellowship could be waiting for you right now.</p>
